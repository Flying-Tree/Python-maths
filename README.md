## factorisation_polynomes_tk.py

Let $P$ be a polynomial function of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Creates a Tkinter window with an entry for $\deg (P)$. When ```<Return>``` is pressed, entries for the numerator and the denominator of the coefficients of $P$ are created. When all the entries are filled and ```<Return>``` pressed again, the program finds every rationnal root of $P$ and, if a trinomial is found in the factorization, the program finds its roots in $\mathbb{C}$. Then, the factorization is printed in the window.
